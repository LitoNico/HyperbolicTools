HyperbolicTools
===============

A set of tools for Modo to generate hyperbolic planes.

Includes:
---------------

Two macros,  
**alteredge_macro.lxm** and **fulledge_macro.lxm**  
that make building the geometry of the hyperbolic surface a little easier

and

**hyperbolictools_cloth.py**   
an implementation of the constraint-solving portion of a verlet-integration based cloth simulation as well as a cloth bending stiffness algorithm. This is what will fold the geometry into its shape.

This script implements pieces of "Advanced Character Physics" (T. Jakobsen, 2003)and "Simple Linear Bending Stiffness in Particle Systems" (Volino and Magnenat-Thalmann, 2006)
