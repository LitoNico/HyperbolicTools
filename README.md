HyperbolicTools
===============

A set of tools for Modo to generate hyperbolic planes.

Includes:
_______________

Two macros, alteredge_macro.lxm and fulledge_macro.lxm  
That make building the geometry of the hyperbolic surface a little easier

and

hyperbolictools_cloth.py  
An implementation of the constraint-solving portion of a verlet-integration based cloth simulation as well as a cloth bending stiffness algorithm

This script implements pieces of "Advanced Character Physics" (T. Jakobsen, 2003)and "Simple Linear Bending Stiffness in Particle Systems" (Volino and Magnenat-Thalmann, 2006)
